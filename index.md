# Marianne Leano
A recent graduate with a Master's in Data Science. Currently looking for a new career as a data science professional to work with a diverse team and support innovation for data-driven business decisions and goals. Motivated to utilize my analytical, statistical, and programming skills to collect, analyze and interpret large datasets.

## Project 1: Predicting Forest Cover Type
* Given raw unscaled data with both numerical and categorical variables.
* Performed exploratory data analysis in order to visualize the characteristics of our given variables.
* Constructed various models to train the data, utilizing Optuna hyperparameter tuning to get parameters that maximize the model accuracies.
* Used feature engineering techniques, we built new variables to help improve the accuracy of the models.
* Using the strategies above, we built the final model and generated the forest cover type predictions for the test dataset.

## Project 2: Climate Change: A Tableau Visualization
* Created an interactive data visualization to raise people's awareness on the issue of climate change.
* Interacted with data to get insights faster and make critical decisions for the purpose of the project.
* Created visualizations with large amounts of data for the following supporting points:
  * Economoic Development
  * Human Influence Factors
  * Energy Consumption

## Project 3: Predictive Modeling with R
* Performed data feature selection, feature eliminateion, and feature importance using techniwues such as Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Random Forest.
* Developed models using supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning techniques such as decision trees, regression trees, neural networks, and support vector machines.
* Tuned model parameters, estimated prediction errors, and model validation.
* Compared and ensembled multiple models in pipeline and automatically selected the best model.

## Project 4: Determining Trade Union Status
* Utitlizing a custom TRAIN dataset, a model was built to predict whether a data scientist will remain a member.
* Performed data cleaning and pre-processing of data.
* Performed PCA and Correlation to understand the relationship between the data.
* Performed the following models: Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree and Random Forest.
* Used Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) for feature selection.
* Compared models to find the best model for testing accuracy and training convergence.

## Project 5: Lahman Baseball Database
* Utilized pyspark ML and created a SparkSession object using Databricks.
* Explored and analyzed different datasets to build better insights on the Lahman Baseball database.
