# Project 1: Forest Cover Type Prediction
* Performed exploratory data analysis in order to visualize the characteristics of our given variables.
* Constructed various models to train the data, utilizing Optuna hyperparameter tuning to get parameters that maximize the model accuracies.
* Used feature engineering techniques and built new variables to help improve the accuracy of our models.
* Built the final model and generated forest cover type predictions for the test dataset.
